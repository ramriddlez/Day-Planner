# Day-Planner

This is a day planner utilizing JQuery and Moment JS.
we use DOM traversion to get the HTML elements that we need to manipulate using defined variables.

we used BOOTSTRAP technologies to create organized Divs and we used fontawesome third party APIs to get the save icon.
Using JQuery, we added a click event listener on the save button to enable local storage technologies.

using Moment JS, we can compare specially made DIV ID's with the format 24 hour clock moment JS could understand, starting from 9AM until 17:00 which is 5PM.
